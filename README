SnipSnapLib
===========

The SnipSnapLib allows you to add your own custom block to Snap! without the need of the `javascript function` block.

All you need to do is
* fork the repository
* edit the `snip.js` to add the desired function
* bookmarkletify it, I recommend [this tool] (https://chriszarate.github.io/bookmarkleter/) **Important** You should not minify the script because this could cause incompatibilities if you have more than one SnipSnapLib active
* drag&drop it in the URL bar of the Snap!-project and enjoy!

Bugs
====

[ ] The bookmarklet makes the browser ask to leave the site
[ ] If a category is selected, an inserted block is not instantly visible there
